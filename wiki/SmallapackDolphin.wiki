= Introduction =

A first port of Smallapack to Dolphin has been achieved.

= Details =

What you need to run Smallapack in Dolphin?

  * Dolphin version 5.1 or X6 [http://www.object-arts.com/]
  * A BLAS and LAPACK dynamic libraries [SmallapackPrerequisistes]
  * Burning River Complex implementation (zip found at http://www.nls.net/mp/jarvis/Bob/DolphinGoodies.htm)
  * extensions to Complex (Smallapack-ComplexExtensions.pac)
  * the Smallapack packages (Smallapack-External.pac, Smallapack-Algorithm.pac, Smallapack-Matrix.pac, Smallapack-SUnitTests.pac)
Optionnaly, stuff that helped generating external interfaces (Smallapack-Builder.pac), VB regex being prerequisite.

I had to place a blas.dll and lapack.dll into Dolphin installation directory.

Port is roughly coming from squeak with regex editing for adapting some behavior and class names...

There must still be some unused methods and unimplemented calls... and of course bugs.

Warning: the packages are not guaranteed to be the latest version previously available since both my previous PC and my http://ncellier.ifrance.com site are dead...
