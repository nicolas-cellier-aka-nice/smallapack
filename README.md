Smallapack provides a set of Smalltalk classes for handling numerical matrices, performing operations on them efficiently (by using BLAS library) and solving some linear algebra problems (by using LAPACK).

What is LAPACK? http://www.netlib.org/lapack is the famous Linear Algebra package.
It provides many robust and efficient (in time and memory) functions for solving a range of problems (least squares, eigenvalues, etc...)

It relies on the existence of an optimized BLAS library for doing basic operations on Matrices and Vectors.
